Animations Prep 
</h1>   
<br>
<p>
    Dr. Bradshaw made a few very interesting animations to display the test grade data that make it easy to read and comprehend. The animations he created are done with a simple hover, which can also be used in CSS. The transitions he used between graphs can be accomplished by selecting an interval.  You can go into more depth and change the transitions by using the D3 algorithm and Javascript. Instead of using a hover effect, you could use a simple 'mouseover' function to recreate the CSS hover effect.

    An example of the code to accomplish this would look like this:
<br>
<br>
    rect:hover *this tells the rectangle svg element what to do when it is hovered over*
<br>
<br>
    fill:purple *this tells it to turn purple when hovered over*
<br>
<br>
    rect {
<br>
<br>
    -moz-transition: all 1.0s;
<br>
<br>
    -o-transition: all 1.0s;
<br>
<br>
    -webkit-transition: all 1.0s;
<br>
<br>
    transition: all 1.0s;
<br>
<br>
    }
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Using this example code would create basic transitions and allow you to transition from one animation to the next like Dr. B did with the test data.
